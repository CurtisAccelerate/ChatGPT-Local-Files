# Configuration for ChatGPT-Local-Files Server
# TEMPLATE CONFIG - Copy to config.toml and customize for your environment
[workspace]
# Specify one or more root directories for file operations
# You can use:
#  - Relative paths (relative to the server directory): "Work", "Projects"
#  - Absolute paths: "C:\\Users\\MyName\\Projects", "/home/user/projects"
#  - Home directory with ~: "~/projects"
# 
# Examples:
# roots = ["Work"]                              # Single relative directory
# roots = ["C:\\MyWork", "D:\\Projects"]        # Multiple absolute Windows paths
# roots = ["/home/user/projects", "~/code"]     # Linux/Mac paths
# 
# The first path in the list is used as the default working directory

roots = ["Work"]  # Default relative path - works out of the box
